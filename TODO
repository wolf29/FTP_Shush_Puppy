I have gotten the misnamed ftp_up.sh script complete to v1.0
11/15/2011 - Filename_Checker.sh and Renamer.sh are also at v1.0.0
To Do:
Marc_Er.sh and Up_Loader.sh and File_Zipper.sh need a lot of work - v0.0.0.0 the lot of them
After that, the logs for these processes need to be combined (probably).
